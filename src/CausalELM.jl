"""
Macros, functions, and structs for applying Extreme Learning Machines to causal inference
tasks where the counterfactual is unavailable or biased and must be predicted. Provides 
macros for event study designs, parametric G-computation, doubly robust estimation, and 
metalearners. Additionally, these tasks can be performed with or without L2 penalization and
will automatically choose the best number of neurons and L2 penalty.
