# Double Machine Learning
Double machine learning, also called debiased or orthogonalized machine learning, enables
estimating causal effects when the dimensionality of the covariates is too high for linear 
regression or the treatment or outcomes cannot be easily modeled parametrically. Double 
machine learning estimates models of the treatment assignment and outcome and then combines 
them in a final model. This is a semiparametric model in the sense that the first stage 
models can take on any functional form but the final stage model is linear.

!!! note
    If regularized is set to true then the ridge penalty will be estimated using generalized 
    cross validation where the maximum number of iterations is 2 * folds for the successive 
    halving procedure. However, if the penalty in on iteration is approximately the same as in 
    the previous penalty, then the procedure will stop early.

    For more information see:

    Chernozhukov, Victor, Denis Chetverikov, Mert Demirer, Esther Duflo, Christian Hansen, 
    Whitney Newey, and James Robins. "Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and 
    structural parameters." (2018): C1-C68.


## Step 1: Initialize a Model
The DoubleMachineLearning constructor takes at least three arguments, an array of 
covariates, a treatment vector, and an outcome vector. This estimator supports binary, count, 
or continuous treatments and binary, count, continuous, or time to event outcomes. You can 
also specify confounders that you do not want to estimate the CATE for by passing a parameter 
to the W argument. Otherwise, the model assumes all possible confounders are contained in X.

!!! note
    Internally, the outcome and treatment models are treated as a regression since extreme 
    learning machines minimize the MSE. This means that predicted treatments and outcomes 
    under treatment and control groups could fall outside [0, 1], although this is not likely 
    in practice. To deal with this, predicted binary variables are automatically clipped to 
    [0.0000001, 0.9999999]. This also means that count outcomes will be predicted as continuous 
    variables.

!!! tip
    You can also specify the following options:  whether to use L2 regularization, the 
    activation function, the number of folds to use for cross fitting, and the number of 
    iterations to perform cross validation. These arguments are specified with the following 
    keyword arguments: regularized, activation, folds, and num\_neurons.
```julia
# Create some data with a binary treatment
X, T, Y, W = rand(100, 5), [rand()<0.4 for i in 1:100], rand(100), rand(100, 4)

# We could also use DataFrames
# using DataFrames
# X = DataFrame(x1=rand(100), x2=rand(100), x3=rand(100), x4=rand(100), x5=rand(100))
# T, Y = DataFrame(t=[rand()<0.4 for i in 1:100]), DataFrame(y=rand(100))
# W = DataFrame(w1=rand(100), w2=rand(100), w3=rand(100), w4=rand(100))

# W is optional and means there are confounders that you are not interested in estimating
# the CATE for
dml = DoubleMachineLearning(X, T, Y, W=W)
```

## Step 2: Estimate the Causal Effect
To estimate the causal effect, we call estimatecausaleffect! on the model above.
```julia
# we could also estimate the ATT by passing quantity_of_interest="ATT"
estimate_causal_effect!(dml)
```

# Get a Summary
We can get a summary that includes a p-value and standard error estimated via asymptotic 
randomization inference by passing our model to the summarize method.

Calling the summarize method returns a dictionary with the estimator's task (regression or 
classification), the quantity of interest being estimated (ATE), whether the model uses an 
L2 penalty (always true for DML), the activation function used in the model's outcome 
predictors, whether the data is temporal (always false for DML), the number of neurons used 
in the ELMs used by the estimator, the causal effect, standard error, and p-value. Due to 
long running times, calculation of the p-value and standard error is not conducted and set 
to NaN unless inference is set to true.
```julia
# Can also use the British spelling
# summarise(dml)

summarize(dml)
```

## Step 4: Validate the Model
We can validate the model by examining the plausibility that the main assumptions of causal 
inference, counterfactual consistency, exchangeability, and positivity, hold. It should be 
noted that consistency and exchangeability are not directly testable, so instead, these 
tests do not provide definitive evidence of a violation of these assumptions. To probe the 
counterfactual consistency assumption, we simulate counterfactual outcomes that are 
different from the observed outcomes, estimate models with the simulated counterfactual 
outcomes, and take the averages. If the outcome is continuous, the noise for the simulated 
counterfactuals is drawn from N(0, dev) for each element in devs, otherwise the default is 
0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 standard deviations from the mean outcome. For discrete variables, 
each outcome is replaced with a different value in the range of outcomes with probability ϵ 
for each ϵ in devs, otherwise the default is 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1. If the average 
estimate for a given level of violation differs greatly from the effect estimated on the 
actual data, then the model is very sensitive to violations of the counterfactual 
consistency assumption for that level of violation. Next, this method tests the model's 
sensitivity to a violation of the exchangeability assumption by calculating the E-value, 
which is the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unobserved 
confounder would need to have with the treatment and outcome variable to fully explain away 
the estimated effect. Thus, higher E-values imply the model is more robust to a violation of 
the exchangeability assumption. Finally, this method tests the positivity assumption by 
estimating propensity scores. Rows in the matrix are levels of covariates that have a zero 
or near zero probability of treatment. If the matrix is empty, none of the observations have 
an estimated zero probability of treatment, which implies the positivity assumption is 
satisfied.

!!! tip
    One can also specify the maxium number of possible treatments to consider for the causal 
    consistency assumption and the minimum and maximum probabilities of treatment for the 
    positivity assumption with the num\_treatments, min, and max keyword arguments.

!!! danger
    Obtaining correct estimates is dependent on meeting the assumptions for double machine 
    learning. If the assumptions are not met then any estimates may be biased and lead to 
    incorrect conclusions.
